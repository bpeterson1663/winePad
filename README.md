# winePad

This project is designed to effectively and efficiently manage wine inventory for commercial use such as a restaurant, private-club or hotel; or for personal use such as a private cellar. This project will have two main portions a back-end administration portion and front-end user experience portion for displaying an interactive wine list available with all the wine in the cellar. The back-end portion will focus on adding, deleting and updating the users wine inventory. Users must login in to the app because each individual user will have their own database/wine cellar. This app is created out of the necessity of maintaining accurate inventory to be able to calculate wine costs, inventory on hand, and reflect accurately the wine list that is available in the cellar. The wine list will display the information to the user in an interactive way that is also non-intimidating and easy to use.
